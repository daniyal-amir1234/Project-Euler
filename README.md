# Project Euler — Python Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to selected [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, written in Python.

Project Euler problems are mathematically and algorithmically focused, and I use them primarily to practise:
- algorithmic problem-solving
- translating mathematical definitions into code
- improving time and space complexity
- writing clear, readable Python

I currently have 13 solved problems, with a focus on correctness first, then optimisation where appropriate.
